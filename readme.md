# connectfour
Simple connect 4 game in C using ncurses. It may be buggy *a bit* and is shitcoded by me in some hours to remember some C.

## Build it
I built it with tcc but you can do it with any compiler with -lncurses flag

## TODO
* [x] more controls(hjkl and 7913)
* [x] make it possible to cancel selection
* [ ] make game layout size selectable by argument in terminal
* [ ] make seed changable by argument too(now you can change it by defined constant value)
